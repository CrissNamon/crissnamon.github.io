## About me
<p>I started my developer way in 2017, when I enrolled in Samsung's IT school for Android developers. Nowadays I'm on my way to backend development with Java and Spring.</p>
<p>I practice my skills and learn new things working on some pet projects. I have them a lot already, but I always find something new and interesting to study.</p>
<p>In my free time I study game development and work on my own game now ðŸ™‚</p>
