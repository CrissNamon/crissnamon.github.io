## Oh, hi you there! ðŸ‘‹

## My projects
- [CompaJ](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj-cloud)
    > Open-source programming and numeric computing platform for math modeling and visualization with fully functional programming language. Includes desktop application and cloud service
- [Progressive](https://github.com/CrissNamon/progressive)
    > Open source java game framework with usefull tools to create game logic easily. Progressive provides IoC/DI container with auto injection through annotations, state management, game objects, game scripts and much more
- [SOLDEEA](https://github.com/CrissNamon/soldeea)
    > Symmetric encryption algorithm based on diophantine equations with java implementation
- [RUVIK Proto](https://github.com/CrissNamon/ruvik-proto-java)
    > Custom end-to-end encryption protocol with java implementation
    
All these and other projects available on my personal GitHub [@CrissNamon](https://github.com/CrissNamon).
